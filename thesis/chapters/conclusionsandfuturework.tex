\section{Conclusions}
TODO CONCLUSIONS
 - It works with crappy hardware
 - 

	

\section{Future Work}
TODO FUTURE WORK
- It works with crappy hardware, try the system on a better platfrom:
	* shorter wires (less noise)
	* better LED (lower t-rise ->  )
- Implement communication algorithm using lights bouncing from the floor to the next light post, to singal it to turn on
