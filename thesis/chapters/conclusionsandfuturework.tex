\section{Future Work}
System improvements
TODO FUTURE WORK
- It works with crappy hardware, try the system on a better platfrom:
	* shorter wires (less noise)
	* better LED (lower t-rise -> more energy saved and less visible light)
	* make the $PD - PD_dark$ work for possibly even better results
- Test the system with a lens like in \cite{PIR_Tracking}, to get even better tracking

Feature expansion
- Implement communication algorithm using lights bouncing from the floor to the next light post, to singal it to turn on.
- Figure out a method to have more of these devices working in one area (make the light flashes not interfere with each others detections)
